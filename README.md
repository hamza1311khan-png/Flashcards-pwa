# Study Cards — GitHub Pages Upload Guide

This folder is ready to be uploaded to GitHub and served via GitHub Pages.

## Publish on GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub named: `flashcards-pwa` (public).
2. Drag & drop the **contents** of this folder into the GitHub repo (do not include the outer folder).
3. Commit the upload.
4. In your repository, go to **Settings → Pages**. Under **Source** choose **Branch: main** and **Folder: / (root)** then Save.
5. Wait ~1–2 minutes. Your site will be available at:
   `https://hamza1311khan-png.github.io/flashcards-pwa/`

## Notes
- The app is a Progressive Web App (PWA). It is installable and works offline after the first load.
- To install on iPhone: open the site in Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen.
- To install on Android: open in Chrome → menu → Install app / Add to Home screen.

If you want, I can also:
- Create a repo and push these files for you (I will provide exact git commands to run locally), or
- Customize the logo further before you publish.
